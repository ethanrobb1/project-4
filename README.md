# UOCIS322 - Project 4 #
Name: Ethan Robb
Description:
You'll learn how to write test cases and test your code, along with more JQuery.
You will reimplement RUSA ACP controle time calculator with Flask and AJAX.
That's *"controle"* with an *e*, because it's French, although "control" is also accepted. Controls are points where a rider must obtain proof of passage, and control[e] times are the minimum and maximum times by which the rider must arrive at the location.
